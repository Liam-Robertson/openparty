Notes: 
- When you give code, give the entire file, don't abbreviate anything
- Don't leave comments in the code, except a comment at a top of the file stating the file path
    - e.g. //File: composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/openparty/app/main/MainViewModel.kt
- Use the cleanest, most robust, scalable architecture you can 
- For every gradle dependency, give it in this format: implementation("org.jetbrains.androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-compose:2.8.2")
    - don't give it in the libs.version.toml format. i.e. don't do this - implementation(compose.components.uiToolingPreview)
    - The exception to this is the dependencies that are already in my gradle files, leave them in the original format
- I'm using koin compose multiplatform for my depedency injection, that means that in my screen classes, I use this import - import org.koin.compose.viewmodel.koinViewModel
    - And the view model is injected like this - viewModel: DiscussionArticleViewModel = koinViewModel()
    - This might look odd to you since it's a new approach but don't change it, assume it's correct

So above i've given you the discussions preview feature for my app and the navigation feature 
a
it all works correctly but i want to add functionality

I have given you my Navigation Footer which is currently not in use 

I want to create a settings feature here: 
package com.openparty.app.features.utils.feature_settings 

The settings feature is going to be very basic for now. It's just going to be a screen with text on it saying "Disclaimer" 

However, I also want to change the navigation footer so that it has the settings screen on it 

The navigation footer should have two segments - one for discussions and one for settings 

the settings one should be represented by a cog, when the user clicks the cog it goes to the settings screen, when the user clicks the discussions icon it goes back to the discussions preview screen
